[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LuvDaSun/less-css-handler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LuvDaSun/less-css-handler)

Middleware for express to compile and server `less` files as `css` files. The files
are being cached via http cache headers. Re-compile all your `less` files simply
by reloading your browser!

This middleware is not suitable for production use. It is only suitable for
development.
